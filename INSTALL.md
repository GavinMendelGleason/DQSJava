Installation Instructions
=========================

In order to install this software, it is necessary to have swipl with the jpl7, and semweb packagse installed.  Once these are installed, edit the DQS file to point to the appropriate paths for the shared library and java archives.

The programme can then be invoked with the DQS script. This script currently recompiles every time, so this can be edited to change that behaviour if you like. Alternatively you can use it as a library to check rdf or turtle files representing OWL ontologies.
